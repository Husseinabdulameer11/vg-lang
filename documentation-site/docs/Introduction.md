# Introduction

VG Language is a lightweight scripting language designed for quick 
prototyping or embedding within other applications. It offers:

- Basic data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Arrays for handling lists
- Standard control flow (if statements, etc.)
- Straightforward variable and constant declarations

## Why Use VG Language?

- **Easy to read**: The syntax is reminiscent of many common scripting languages.
- **Flexible**: Allows expressions, variables, and arrays without excessive boilerplate.
- **Great for learning**: If you're new to programming, VG Language's simpler grammar 
  and straightforward statements are easier to grasp.

## Getting Started

To run VG Language code, you could:
1. Use the official interpreter (if provided).
2. Integrate the language library in your own application.
3. Write `.vg` files and run them from the command line or a host program 
   that embeds the interpreter.

Once you have a way to run the code, feel free to experiment with 
the [Statements](statements.md) reference!
